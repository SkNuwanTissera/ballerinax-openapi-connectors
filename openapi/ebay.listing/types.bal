Supported item conditions can vary by eBay category. To see which item conditions are supported for a category, you can use the getItemConditionPolicies method of the Metadata API. Note: The 'Manufacturer Refurbished' item condition is no longer a valid item condition in any eBay marketplace, and to reflect this change, the pre-existing MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED enumeration value has been replaced by the CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED enumeration value. CR-eligible sellers should make a note to start using CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED from this point forward. To list an item as 'Certified Refurbished', a seller must be pre-qualified by eBay for this feature. Any seller who is not eligible for this feature will be blocked if they try to create a new listing or revise an existing listing with this item condition. Any seller that is interested in eligibility requirements to list with 'Certified Refurbished' should see the Certified refurbished program page in Seller Center.
